### Faulty/damaged files

Music data file is one byte too short and thus is corrupting the last
sound macro offset. As a result, an instrument is not played. Only obvious,
if you know these ingame tunes from ``Quik & Silva``:

```

 010c7c61d537d4d3b961bf288c307f82  Q&S-INGA.SAM

 efe7ca7a7598aa80c5fc5342c8f16908  Quik And Silva - Ingame.tfx
 a7e3a6836311bdc97428672c2ca8222a  Quik And Silva - Ingame.sam
```


Header has been invalidated with a flood of 0x0d values, which breaks
all TFMX players that expect the space character after the "TFMX-SONG" tag.
The structure's two fields about compression have become invalid, too.
The sample data possibly are shifted by four bytes, which causes clearly
audible clicks:
